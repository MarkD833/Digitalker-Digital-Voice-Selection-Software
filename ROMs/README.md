This directory contains the ROMs I've created that hold all of the numbers, letters, words and sounds etc that form the DVSS vocabulary.

There are 5 individual ROMs, each in Intel-HEX format. The 6th file, called DVSSROMS.HEX is a combination of all 5 ROMs into one Intel-HEX format file.

Please see the DVSS_ROMS_Index PDF document for the index to the ROMS.
